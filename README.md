# Central - vision and scope

It has been realized that although cross-platform system has big advantage in saving development cost and consistent interface, but the lack of rich, extended user experience of native platforms actually prevented more users to accept the system. This is the purpose of Central project.

Beyond a cross-platform system, Central targets on bringing comprehensive native user experience into cross-platform system by defining an adaptive framework to bridge the cross-platform core to multiple native platform.

Central can be used with MindPX autopilots, PX4 autopilots, MindRacer series, and all dronetag technology enabled components, to easily and intuitively access these systems/nodes and exchange information in between from single point of entry.

Central supports DroneTag Communication technology in order to enable contactless/cable free access and telemetry, which can greatly help to increase user experience.
