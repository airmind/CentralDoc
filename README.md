# Central - vision and scope

Central can be used with PX4 autopilots, MindPX autopilots, MindRacer series, and all dronetag technology enabled components, to easily and intuitively access these systems/nodes and exchange information in between from single point of entry.

Central supports Near Field Communication technology in order to enable contactless/cable free access and telemetry, which can greatly help to increase user experience.

Central is built to support multiple platform. It has been realized that although cross-platform system has big advantage in development cost and consistent interface, but the lack of extended user experience actually will prevent more users to accept the system. 

Beyond a cross-platform system, Central targets on bringing comprehensive native user experience into cross-platform system by defining an adaptive framework to bridge the cross-platform core to multiple native platform.
