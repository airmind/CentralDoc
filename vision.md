# Central - vision and scope

Central can be used with PX4 autopilots, MindPX autopilots, MindRacer series, and DroneTag compliant ESCs, to easily and intuitively access & configure these systems/nodes.

Central supports Near Field Communication technology in order to enable contactless/cablefree access and telemetry, which can greatly help to increase user experience.

Central is built to support multiple platform. Beyond a cross-platform system, Central targets on bring native user experience into cross-platform system. It has been realized that although
cross-platform system has big advantage in development cost and consistent interface, but the lack of extended user experience actually will prevent more users to accept the system. Central
defines an adaptive framework to bridge the cross-platform core to multiple native platform, and enhances the cross-platform with extensive native platform user experience.
